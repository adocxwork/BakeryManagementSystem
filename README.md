# Bakery Management System

This is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) project built using Python. It helps bakery shop owners manage their daily tasks like billing, stock management, and transactions. I created this project during my school days using simple file handling in Python.

## Features

* Manage billing and customer transactions
* Check available stock and update it
* Store and manage passwords securely
* Track available money in the shop
* Simple and easy to use through the terminal

## How It Works

The project does not use any database. Instead, it uses plain text files to store data:

* `money.txt` – stores available money
* `pass.txt` – stores login or admin password
* `stock.txt` – stores items and their quantities

The program reads from and writes to these files to keep the data up to date.

## Tech Stack

* Python (Core language)
* Text files (as storage)

## Why This Project is Special

I created this project during my school days with no experience in databases. I used my own logic and simple file handling in Python to build a working management system. It helped me learn how to solve real-life problems using code.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repo or download the files.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the main Python file:

   ```bash
   python sc.py
   ```
5. Follow the instructions on the screen.

> Note: Make sure the `money.txt`, `pass.txt`, and `stock.txt` files are in the same folder as the Python script.

## Folder Structure

```

## License

This project is open-source and free to use for learning purposes.
